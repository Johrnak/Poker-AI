# Poker AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An AI approach to playing poker well. Basically the AI would take a gamestate and give a recommendation on how to play. 
One could think of it as being in the same vein as board analysis commonly found on chess sites with different percentages shown and so on.


## Background
There are already many different poker bots around, though I would find it interesting to develop one of my own and see how strong it could become.


## How is it used?

You could use it when playing poker with your friends (for fun ofcourse) or maybe to learn how to improve your own strategy.
Possibly one could play against the AI in some manner too.


## Data sources and AI methods
Supposedly the AI could play many games against other players (humans or bots) to come up with a good strategy.

## Challenges
Certainly such an AI could be used when playing against other humans (which would be illegal) somewhat like using a computer when playing chess.

## What next?
I reckon there are many such AI:s already but with time I could try to develop my own.
